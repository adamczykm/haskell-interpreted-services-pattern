## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation and explanation of functional architectural pattern
meant for larger-scale applications.
It is implemented using Haskell but probably, it's possible to translate it to other functional
languages.
The concept is based on the attempt to combine patterns described in great articles
by John A De Goes:  
- http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp
- http://degoes.net/articles/modern-fp-part-2
and Matt Parsons:  
- http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2016/07/14/rank_n_classy_limited_effects.html
and heavily inspired by them, and probably many others I came along while exploring
arcanas of functional programming.

You can find it in /src/Lib.lhs (literate Haskell), the rest of files is just
a basic stack template with which I started my experimentations.

The pattern idea is to work within a context confined to a generic monad interface
with access to abstracted languages grouped in so called services.

Each service is an interpreter for some top-level languages. Interpreters combine
horizontally and vertically and thus allow for modular and cleanly defined semantics
by using "the union architecture".

The actuall implementation of services is passed to the application by its "runner",
without any modification in application code. This way you can create configurations
for different protocols, databases, tests, etc.

The pattern is experimental and not tested in real-life applications nor benchmarked.

If you find it interesting I invite you to read the code in src/Lib.lhs file
and of course the aforementioned articles which provide much better introuction to the concept.

Should you notice mistakes and/or ways to improve my solution - I'll be glad to hear
from you.

Regards!
